- #### How To's
- #### Reference Materials
- #### Documentation
- #### Issues
- #### Roadmap

### How To's
#### This pertains to how it is that things should be done, This is espcially useful for the people that have not worked with the technologies that we are using very much as well as a good place that will hold the reminders. Each document will contain a step by step outline to get you through the thing that you are currently working on. 

### Reference Materials
#### This pertains to a list of links that can be used to get to reference points for anything that will be needed in the Use of JavaScript or anything that would be found on the React Native site and would be used as a quick reference to the exact point that you would need

### Documentation
#### This pertains all of the in house documentation that pertains to all forms of the app. Ideally, this would contain the major functions and or class descriptions in one location allowing for lookups and having written documentation for the project as a whole which can be referenced to. **This will not be done right away as we are still working on producing this code and this portion will continue to be added to and edited as the code itself changes**

### Issues
#### The issues that are going on with the **Entire** project are presented here. This will be bugs that are affecting the project as a whole all issues that are only pertaining to one portion should be found in the repository that the problems reside. the criteria for putting the issue in the Wiki is that it has to be effecting **At least 2 of the repos** to post in the issues here
the stories are found here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ecnuiVCXN6DClOeQA_Uj4Sv8ChLR-fH4mKpcu-1XPCI/edit#gid=0 
Will be migrated to the issues tab in This repo(the Wiki)


### Roadmap
#### The roadmap is the general expectation for the direction of which the project is expected to be going in. This sort of thing is seperated out into the different quarters at the end of each 3 months is the end of the quarter. If things are perdicted to be done and are not done within the current quarter, they will be moved to the next quarter, most likely being put into a higher level of priority to make sure that they get done in the next quarter. These sort of expectations will be made known directly during the meetings as well as on a personal basis depending on the circumstances
